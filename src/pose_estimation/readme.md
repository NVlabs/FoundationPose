We present FoundationPose, a unified foundation model for 6D object pose estimation and tracking, supporting both model-based and model-free setups. Our approach can be instantly applied at test-time to a novel object without fine-tuning, as long as its CAD model is given, or a small number of reference images are captured. We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin. In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions.

# Data prepare


1) Download all network weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DFezOAD0oD1BblsXVxqDsl8fj0qzB82i?usp=sharing) and put them under the folder `weights/`

1) [Download demo data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRyFmxYXmAnpku7nGRioZaKrVJtIsroP?usp=sharing) and extract them under the folder `demo_data/`

1) [Optional] Download our large-scale training data: ["FoundationPose Dataset"](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s4pB6p4ApfWMiMjmTXOFco8dHbNXikp-?usp=sharing)

1) [Optional] Download our preprocessed reference views [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PXXCOJqHXwQTbwPwPbGDN9_vLVe0XpFS?usp=sharing) in order to run model-free few-shot version.

# Env setup option 1: docker (recommended)
  ```
  cd docker/
  docker pull wenbowen123/foundationpose && docker tag wenbowen123/foundationpose foundationpose  # Or to build from scratch: docker build --network host -t foundationpose .
  bash docker/run_container.sh
  ```


If it's the first time you launch the container, you need to build extensions.
```
bash build_all.sh
```

Later you can execute into the container without re-build.
```
docker exec -it foundationpose bash
```

# Env setup option 2: conda (experimental)

- Setup conda environment

```bash
# create conda environment
conda create -n foundationpose python=3.9

# activate conda environment
conda activate foundationpose

# Install Eigen3 3.4.0 under conda environment
conda install conda-forge::eigen=3.4.0
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:/eigen/path/under/conda"

# install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install NVDiffRast
python -m pip install --quiet --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast.git

# Kaolin (Optional, needed if running model-free setup)
python -m pip install --quiet --no-cache-dir kaolin==0.15.0 -f https://nvidia-kaolin.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/torch-2.0.0_cu118.html

# PyTorch3D
python -m pip install --quiet --no-index --no-cache-dir pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py39_cu118_pyt200/download.html

# Build extensions
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pybind11/share/cmake/pybind11 bash build_all_conda.sh
```


# Run model-based demo
The paths have been set in argparse by default. If you need to change the scene, you can pass the args accordingly. By running on the demo data, you should be able to see the robot manipulating the mustard bottle. Pose estimation is conducted on the first frame, then it automatically switches to tracking mode for the rest of the video. The resulting visualizations will be saved to the `debug_dir` specified in the argparse. (Note the first time running could be slower due to online compilation)
```
python run_demo.py
```

Feel free to try on other objects (**no need to retrain**) such as driller, by changing the paths in argparse.

# Run on public datasets (LINEMOD, YCB-Video)

For this you first need to download LINEMOD dataset and YCB-Video dataset.

To run model-based version on these two datasets respectively, set the paths based on where you download. The results will be saved to `debug` folder
```
python run_linemod.py --linemod_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/LINEMOD --use_reconstructed_mesh 0

python run_ycb_video.py --ycbv_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video --use_reconstructed_mesh 0
```

To run model-free few-shot version. You first need to train Neural Object Field. `ref_view_dir` is based on where you download in the above "Data prepare" section. Set the `dataset` flag to your interested dataset.
```
python bundlesdf/run_nerf.py --ref_view_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video/bowen_addon/ref_views_16 --dataset ycbv
```

Then run the similar command as the model-based version with some small modifications. Here we are using YCB-Video as example:
```
python run_ycb_video.py --ycbv_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video --use_reconstructed_mesh 1 --ref_view_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video/bowen_addon/ref_views_16
```

# Notes
Due to the legal restrictions of Stable-Diffusion that is trained on LAION dataset, we are not able to release the diffusion-based texture augmented data, nor the pretrained weights using it. We thus release the version without training on diffusion-augmented data. Slight performance degradation is expected.
